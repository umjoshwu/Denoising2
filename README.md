Our project focuses on implementing various denoising techniques to fix the quality of images destroyed by noise. Our data revolves around 100 clean images obtained from BSD300. Due to these images being clean, we implemented a code that gave them noise such as Gaussian and Salt and Pepper. Our main objective was to clean the images using Bilateral filtering and wavelet-based denoising. Furthermore, we tested our results by verifying with Peak signal to noise ratio and also Structural Similarity Index.
